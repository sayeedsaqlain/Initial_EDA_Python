# Initial_EDA_Python

In this project, I will be working with transactional data from an online retail store. The dataset contains information about customer purchases, including product details, quantities, prices, and timestamps. The task is to explore, clean and analyze this dataset to gain insights into the store's sales trends, customer behavior, and popular products.
